# UX Onboarding Intern Project
## A Generic User Management Application


![User Profile App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakekemple/UXonboarding/angularjs/appView.png)

This App allows for load-free, viewing of a users list, profiles of each user, and appropriate modification capabilities

### Languages/Tools/Dependencies 
- HTML/CSS/jQuery
- AngularJS
- NPM/Node.js
- Grunt
- MongoDB


###What works now:

Page layout(html/css), jquery minimize, 'grunt connect' works to create local server instance, Node/NPM installed, User List &amp; Profile populates from MongoDB local database, &amp; dynamic editing and removal of users   


###Steps to view demo:
- Clone project to desktop from github
- Download and Setup MongoDB Correctly, then run "Mongod" from terminal
- Clone and go to API directory in new terminal, and run "node index" (Internal API Project)
- Open another terminal instance &amp; change directory to the project directory
- run the command "grunt connect"
- A live demo should be open in your browser

### NOTE: Still in developmental stages
