# UX Onboarding Intern Project
## A Generic User Management Application


![User Profile App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakekemple/UXonboarding/node_npm/appView.png)

This App allows for dynamic viewing of a users list, profiles of each user, and modification of a chosen user profile

### Languages/Tools/Dependencies 
- HTML/CSS/jQuery
- AngularJS
- NPM/Node.js
- Grunt
- MongoDB


###What works now:

Page layout(html/css), jquery minimize, 'grunt connect' works to create local server instance, Node/NPM installed, &amp; angular library installed as dependency


###Steps to view demo:
- Clone project to desktop from github
- Open terminal and go to change directory to the project directory
- run the command "grunt connect"
- A live demo should be open in your browser

### NOTE: Still in developmental stages
